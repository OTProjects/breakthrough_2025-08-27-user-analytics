# Analytics Interpretation Guide

This guide helps you understand how to read and act on the analytics data shown in the Analytics Lab dashboard.

## ðŸ“Š Chart-by-Chart Guide

### Daily Active Users (DAU) & Weekly Active Users (WAU)

**What it shows:** Number of unique users visiting your app each day, with a 7-day rolling average.

**How to read it:**
- **Upward trend** = Growth (good!)
- **Flat line** = Stable user base
- **Downward trend** = Declining usage (investigate!)
- **Weekend dips** = Normal for business apps
- **Sudden spikes** = Marketing campaigns or viral growth (validate it's real users, not bots)

**Red flags:**
- Sharp decline after product launches
- Consistent week-over-week drops
- Spikes followed by immediate drops (suggests poor retention)

**Actions to take:**
- Declining DAU: Focus on user acquisition and retention
- Stable DAU: Look for growth opportunities or improve activation
- Spiky DAU: Smooth out with consistent marketing or improved onboarding

### Conversion Funnel

**What it shows:** How users progress through key actions in your app (visit â†’ create â†’ complete â†’ share).

**How to read it:**
- **Drop-off percentage** between steps shows conversion rates
- **Biggest drop-off** (highlighted in red) is your priority area
- **Industry benchmarks**: Visit to signup (2-5%), signup to first action (20-40%)

**Common patterns:**
- **High visit-to-signup drop**: Poor value proposition or confusing landing page
- **High signup-to-activation drop**: Bad onboarding experience
- **Low feature adoption**: Feature isn't discoverable or valuable

**Actions to take:**
1. Focus on the biggest drop-off first
2. A/B test fewer steps, clearer CTAs, or better messaging
3. Add user research to understand why users drop off
4. Remove friction (reduce form fields, simplify UI)

### User Retention Curve

**What it shows:** What percentage of users return after their first visit over time (D1, D7, D30).

**How to read it:**
- **D1 retention**: Most critical metric. Users who don't return the next day rarely return at all
- **The curve flattens**: Users who stick around longer tend to keep coming back
- **Grade system**: A (excellent), B (good), C (average), D (poor)

**Industry benchmarks:**
- Social apps: ~25% D1, ~15% D7
- Productivity apps: ~15% D1, ~8% D7  
- Gaming apps: ~40% D1, ~20% D7

**Red flags:**
- D1 retention < 10% (users don't see value quickly)
- Steep continued decline (no habit formation)
- Much worse than industry benchmark

**Actions to take:**
- Low D1: Improve first-time experience, faster time-to-value
- Poor D7: Add engagement features, push notifications, habit-forming loops
- Compare retained vs. churned users to find success patterns

### A/B Test Results

**What it shows:** Performance comparison between control and treatment groups with statistical analysis.

**How to read it:**
- **Conversion rates**: Primary metric for each group
- **Uplift**: Percentage improvement of treatment vs. control
- **Confidence level**: Statistical certainty of the result (need >95% to act)
- **Sample size**: Number of users in each group

**Making decisions:**
- **High confidence (95%+) + positive uplift**: Ship the treatment
- **High confidence + negative uplift**: Kill the treatment  
- **Low confidence (<95%)**: Continue testing or increase sample size
- **Practical significance**: 0.1% improvement might be statistically significant but not worth implementing

**Common mistakes:**
- Stopping tests too early (need full business cycle)
- Making decisions on low sample sizes
- Ignoring practical significance
- Running too many simultaneous tests

### NPS (Net Promoter Score)

**What it shows:** User loyalty measured by likelihood to recommend (0-10 scale).

**How to read it:**
- **Promoters (9-10)**: Loyal enthusiasts who drive growth
- **Passives (7-8)**: Satisfied but unenthusiastic, vulnerable to competition
- **Detractors (0-6)**: Unhappy users who may damage your brand
- **NPS Score**: (% Promoters) - (% Detractors), ranges from -100 to +100

**Benchmarks:**
- Excellent: 70+
- Great: 50-70
- Good: 30-50
- Poor: 0-30
- Critical: Below 0

**Actions to take:**
- **Low NPS**: Address top complaints, improve core features
- **High NPS**: Focus on growth, leverage promoters for referrals
- **Segment analysis**: Look at NPS by user type, usage patterns, features used

---

### Feedback Word Cloud & Sentiment

**What it shows:** Most frequently mentioned words from user feedback, colored by sentiment.

**How to read it:**
- **Size** = frequency (bigger words mentioned more often)
- **Color** = sentiment (green = positive, red = negative, gray = neutral)
- **Patterns** = recurring themes in user feedback

**Looking for:**
- Negative frequent words = areas needing improvement
- Positive frequent words = strengths to double down on
- Unexpected themes = opportunities you hadn't considered

**Actions to take:**
- Address negative themes with product improvements
- Amplify positive themes in marketing
- Follow up with users who mention specific issues
- Track theme changes over time

## ðŸš¨ Bad Analytics Smells

### Data Quality Issues
- **Sudden metric spikes**: Often indicates tracking bugs or bot traffic
- **Round numbers**: Suggests estimates rather than real measurements  
- **Missing data**: Gaps in charts indicate tracking problems
- **Impossible values**: Retention >100%, negative users, etc.

### Analysis Mistakes
- **Vanity metrics**: Tracking metrics that don't drive decisions (total users vs. active users)
- **Correlation hunting**: Finding patterns in random data (look for causation)
- **Cherry picking**: Choosing favorable time periods or segments
- **HARKing**: Hypothesizing After Results are Known

### Organizational Problems
- **Too many metrics**: Focus on 2-3 key metrics rather than tracking everything
- **No action plans**: Metrics without clear next steps aren't useful
- **Analysis paralysis**: Spending more time analyzing than acting
- **Metric competition**: Teams gaming metrics instead of improving outcomes

## ðŸ“‹ Planning an Event Taxonomy

### Before You Start Tracking

1. **Define your goals**: What decisions will this data help you make?
2. **Map user journey**: What steps do users take to reach success?
3. **Identify key moments**: Sign up, first value, habit formation, churn
4. **Choose naming convention**: Use consistent format (verb_noun, like "checklist_create")

### Event Naming Best Practices

```javascript
// Good examples
track('checklist_create', { title, items_count, experiment_variant })
track('page_view', { page, referrer, user_type })
track('feature_enabled', { feature_name, plan_type })

// Bad examples  
track('click') // Too generic
track('user_did_something_on_checklist_page') // Too verbose
track('CreateChecklist') // Inconsistent casing
```

### Required Properties

**Every event should include:**
- `user_id`: For user-level analysis
- `session_id`: For session analysis  
- `timestamp`: For time-based analysis
- `experiment_variants`: For A/B test analysis

**Context properties:**
- `page`: Current page/screen
- `referrer`: How user arrived
- `user_agent`: Device/browser info
- `feature_flags`: Active experiments

## ðŸ§ª Experiment Readiness Checklist

### Before Launching
- [ ] **Clear hypothesis**: "I believe [change] will cause [outcome] because [reasoning]"
- [ ] **Primary metric defined**: Single most important measurement
- [ ] **Sample size calculated**: How many users needed for statistical power
- [ ] **Success criteria set**: What result would make you ship vs. kill
- [ ] **Duration planned**: How long to run (minimum 1-2 weeks)
- [ ] **Randomization verified**: Users properly split between variants
- [ ] **Tracking implemented**: All events firing correctly

### During the Test
- [ ] **Monitor for bugs**: No technical issues affecting results
- [ ] **Check for bias**: No systematic differences between groups
- [ ] **Avoid peeking**: Don't stop early based on intermediate results
- [ ] **Document learnings**: What worked, what didn't, why

### After the Test
- [ ] **Statistical significance**: 95%+ confidence level
- [ ] **Practical significance**: Large enough impact to matter
- [ ] **Segment analysis**: Does effect hold across user types?
- [ ] **Long-term impact**: Monitor for delayed effects (Novelty effect)

## ðŸ“ˆ Making Data-Driven Decisions

### The DECIDE Framework

1. **D**efine the problem clearly
2. **E**valuate alternatives (what could you build?)
3. **C**onsider consequences (what might go wrong?)
4. **I**dentify best alternatives (based on data)  
5. **D**evelop and implement action plan
6. **E**valuate and monitor solution

### Balancing Data with Intuition

**Use data for:**
- Measuring current state
- Identifying problems
- Validating solutions  
- Prioritizing improvements

**Use intuition for:**
- Generating hypotheses
- Understanding context
- Making qualitative assessments
- Long-term vision

### Common Decision Pitfalls

- **Local optima**: Optimizing the wrong thing (clicks vs. satisfaction)
- **Short-term thinking**: Sacrificing long-term health for quick wins
- **Analysis paralysis**: Waiting for perfect data instead of making good decisions
- **Confirmation bias**: Only looking for data that supports your preferred option

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

After mastering these concepts:

1. **Advanced Statistics**: Learn about Bayesian testing, confidence intervals, power analysis
2. **Segmentation**: Analyze different user groups (new vs. returning, paid vs. free)
3. **Cohort Analysis**: Track user behavior changes over time
4. **Predictive Analytics**: Use machine learning for churn prediction and user scoring
5. **Real-time Dashboards**: Build live monitoring for critical metrics

Remember: The goal isn't perfect data, it's better decisions. Start with simple tracking, learn from your users, and iterate based on what you discover.
